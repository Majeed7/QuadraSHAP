# QuadraSHAP: Stable and Scalable Shapley Values for Product Games via Gauss-Legendre Quadrature

This repository provides the official implementation accompanying the paper:

> **QuadraSHAP: Stable and Scalable Shapley Values for Product Games via Gauss-Legendre Quadrature**

QuadraSHAP reformulates Shapley-value computation for product games as a Gauss-Legendre quadrature problem, yielding estimates that are both numerically stable and scalable to high-dimensional settings. The library covers two concrete application domains:

- **`TreeExplainer`**: TreeSHAP-style explanations for scikit-learn tree models, with interchangeable numerical backends.
- **Product-kernel explainers**: local Shapley values for models whose prediction function factorizes across features, such as RBF kernel methods.

The repository is organized as a research artifact: library code lives under `src/`, correctness tests under `tests/`, and benchmark scripts with precomputed outputs under `benchmarks/`.

## Repository Structure

| Path | Description |
|---|---|
| `src/quadrashap/` | Package source code |
| `src/quadrashap/treeshap/` | Tree-model explainers and numerical backends |
| `src/quadrashap/kernels/` | Explainers for product-form kernel models |
| `csrc/` | Optional C++ extension for the quadrature-tree backend |
| `tests/` | Correctness and regression tests |
| `benchmarks/` | Scripts for runtime and approximation experiments |
| `benchmarks/results/` | Saved benchmark outputs and figures |
| `model/` | Cached models used by the text-classification benchmarks |

## Installation

The package requires Python `>=3.11`.

**Using `uv` (recommended):**

```bash
uv sync --extra jax --group testing
```

**Using `pip`:**

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .[jax]
pip install pytest pytest-benchmark scikit-learn shap
```

> **Notes**
> - The build system attempts to compile the optional C++ extension if a compatible compiler is detected. If compilation fails, installation falls back gracefully to a pure-Python build.
> - JAX is optional for some backends, but `jax` and `jaxlib` are currently declared as core dependencies in `pyproject.toml`.

## Quick Start

### Tree models

`quadrashap.TreeExplainer` follows the familiar SHAP-style interface for supported scikit-learn tree models.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.datasets import make_regression
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

from quadrashap import TreeExplainer

X, y = make_regression(n_samples=300, n_features=6, random_state=0)
model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=8, max_depth=4, random_state=0).fit(X, y)

explainer = TreeExplainer(model, tree_solver="product_games")
phi = explainer.shap_values(X[:10])

print(phi.shape)          # (10, 6)
print(explainer.expected_value)
```

**Available tree backends (`tree_solver`):**

| Value | Description |
|---|---|
| `"product_games"` | TreeSHAP via product-game factorization |
| `"quadrature_tree"` | Direct quadrature-tree backend |

**Useful options:**

| Option | Values |
|---|---|
| `backend_method` | `"numpy_prefix_scan"`, `"numpy_logspace"`, `"jax_prefix_scan"`, `"jax_logspace"` |
| `m_q` | Number of quadrature nodes (integer) |
| `use_cpp` | `True` / `False` (quadrature-tree backend only) |

**Current limitations:**

- Only `model_output="raw"` is supported.
- Only `feature_perturbation="tree_path_dependent"` is implemented.
- The frontend currently targets scikit-learn tree estimators.

### Product-kernel models

For kernel methods with factorized feature kernels, use `RBFLocalExplainer` or `ProductKernelLocalExplainer`.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.datasets import make_regression
from sklearn.kernel_ridge import KernelRidge

from quadrashap.kernels.explainer import RBFLocalExplainer

X, y = make_regression(n_samples=200, n_features=5, random_state=0)
model = KernelRidge(kernel="rbf", gamma=0.5, alpha=1.0).fit(X, y)

explainer = RBFLocalExplainer(model)
phi = explainer.explain(X[0], method="logspace_numpy")

print(phi.shape)          # (5,)
```

**Supported kernel backends (`method`):** `logspace_numpy`, `logspace_jax`, `prefix_scan_numpy`, `prefix_scan_jax`.

## Running Tests

```bash
pytest tests
```

The test suite verifies:

- agreement with naive Shapley implementations on small problems;
- frontend conversion from scikit-learn trees to the internal unified format;
- end-to-end agreement with `shap.TreeExplainer` on supported tree models;
- optional C++ extension behavior.

## Reproducing Experiments

All benchmark scripts are run from the repository root.

### 1. Quadrature-node convergence for kernel explainers

Generate raw convergence data:

```bash
python benchmarks/bench_mq_sweep.py
```

Aggregate and plot results:

```bash
python benchmarks/plot_mq_results.py
```

Outputs are written to `benchmarks/results/mq/`.

### 2. TreeSHAP runtime benchmark

```bash
python benchmarks/treeshap_bench.py
```

Compares several TreeSHAP implementations across varying tree sizes. Results are saved to `benchmarks/treeshap_bench_results.json`.

### 3. Text-classification benchmark

```bash
python benchmarks/text_classification_benchmark.py
```

Evaluates tree and kernel explainers on TF-IDF text-classification setups. Outputs are written to `benchmarks/results/text_clf/`.

> Additional dependencies may be required: `datasets`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scipy`, `joblib`, and optionally `optuna`.

## Precomputed Results

Saved benchmark artifacts are included for inspection without rerunning experiments:

- `benchmarks/results/mq/` — convergence CSVs and figures for the quadrature-node sweep
- `benchmarks/results/text/` — tables and plots from the text-classification benchmark

## Implementation Notes

- The package uses `scikit-build-core` and `pybind11` for the optional C++ extension.
- Tree explanations are computed via an internal unified tree representation converted from scikit-learn models.
- Kernel explainers use Gauss-Legendre quadrature with a configurable number of nodes `m_q`; when unset, a default is chosen based on the feature dimension.
